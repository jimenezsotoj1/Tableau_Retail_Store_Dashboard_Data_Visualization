# Tableau_Retail_Store_Dashboard

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to enhance my data visualization skills in Tableau for current and future work. In this case study, I have used a sample dataset to create a Sales dashboard for a retail food store. 

## Business Tasks
The dashboard seeks to answer the following business questions:

* Which are the best and worst performing products?
* What are the top-selling products in each city?
* Which product has the highest sales volume?
* How do monthly sales figures vary?
* Which specific type of each product is the most successful?

## Process
#### Data Sources Used:
I downloaded the CSV files from the **[Source](https://github.com/chrisfrenchjr/SQLQueries/blob/main/Retail%20Sales%20Data.xlsx)** and uploaded them to Tableau.
