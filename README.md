# Tableau_Retail_Store_Dashboard

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to practice my data visualization skills in Tableau so that I may continue implementing  it in my currrent/future work. For this case study, I decided to use a sample **[data](https://github.com/chrisfrenchjr/SQLQueries/blob/main/Retail%20Sales%20Data.xlsx)** set to create a Sales dashboard for a retail food store. 

## Business Tasks
#### Business Tasks:

* What are the best and worst performing products?
* Which products are top-selling in each city?
* What product has the most volume of sales?
* How do sales change on a monthly basis?
* What specific type of each product is most successful?

## Process
#### Data Sources Used:
I first downloaded the csv files from our source and uploaded it to Tableau.
