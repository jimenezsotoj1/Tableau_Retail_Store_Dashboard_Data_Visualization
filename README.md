# Tableau_Retail_Store_Dashboard

## Introduction
This dashboard presents product performance data for a retail store, with the goal of helping business leaders better understand their best and worst performing products and make informed decisions about product investment, divestment, and relocation. The data used in this analysis was sourced from **[GitHub](https://github.com/chrisfrenchjr/SQLQueries/blob/main/Retail%20Sales%20Data.xlsx)** and uploaded them to Tableau., and is based on 1 year period (2020). The aim of this project is to enhance my data visualization skills in Tableau for current and future work. In this case study, I have used a sample dataset to create a Sales dashboard for a retail food store. 

## Business Objectives
The dashboard seeks to answer the following business questions:

* Which products are top performers in terms of revenue, and which are underperforming?
* Are there any notable trends or patterns in the data that may signal opportunities for growth?
* Which product categories have the highest sales volumes?
* How do product sales vary by location, time, and salesperson?

## Process
#### Data Sources Used:
The csv file contained 10 columns and 123 rows of Data. It provides information onthe Sale Order date, Month, Region, City, Category, Product, Quantity, Unit Price, Total Price and Salesperson.
